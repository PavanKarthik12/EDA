# Exploratory Data Analysis
 
EDA is one of the major import phase we do in data science life cycle in python we have multiple automated and manual tools to do this EDA Analysis some sample automated tools were as follows :

### pandas_profiling
### 

what we do in this EDA :

### i) We will do profile build in this phase 

   1) Total no of rows
   2) Total no of columns
   3) We will see no of missing values
   4) Duplicates if any 
   5) Data type of each data

### ii) Statsical Analysis :
   
   1) Variance of each feature of data : Variance is about the spread of data 
   2) Co Variance between features : it is used to identify how features were linked to each other like whether they were dependent,independent 
   3) Standard Deviation : SD of each individual data point is used to find how far the data point is there from mean
   4) Correlation : it is similar to co varaince but we will have multiple but in co variance we don't have restriction for +ve value or -ve value we will restrict the relation value between some range using multple methods
   5) Measure of central tendency : finding mean,median and mode which will be mostly used to fill missing values in feature engineering

### iii) Graph Base Analysis :
  
  1) Boxplot : using which we can find outliers 
  2) Histogram : We can see how the data is distributed
